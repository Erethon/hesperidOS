* Hesperides OS
My NixOS configuration files. The name of the repo is a "pun" for Nix -> Nyx
-> Hesperides -> HesperidOS.

I'm still very new to NixOS, so I might be doing things in a very
wrong/non-optimal way that happens to work by luck, any feedback is highly
appreciated.

** How to deploy
#+begin_src sh
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake <path_to_repo>/hesperidOS/#niato
#+end_src
